## TODOs and Ideas
- Implement Smithing stat 
  - stat cannot be leveled with xp but only through using it
  - add a new Workstation complementing this stat
  - in this new workstation, the user is able to increase the stats of weapons and armor
  - stat increase is dependent on smithing level
  - also affects starting stats of crafted items
  - let this decrease the cost of combining items in the anvil?

- Rework xp to qi?
  - add qi pills that can drop from enemies, that act as stored qi/xp
  - qi absorption enchantment for more qi/xp dropped from enemies
